# rss-apifier
This app parses and indexes RSS feeds, so that their entries can be searched and queried via API calls. The app allows you to:

* Register any valid RSS 2.0 feed for parsing
* Index multiple feeds in a single database backend
* Set schedule and frequency for retrieving newly published entries from feed sources on a regular basis
* Expose the indexed entries via REST API endpoints (to be implemented)
* Enable queries based on different filters (date published, keyword, publisher, etc.) (to be implemented)
* Handle user registration and authentication (to be implemented)
